 * A pointcut helps in determining the join points (ie methods) of interest to be executed

 * While working with @AspectJ-based configuration,
 * pointcut declaration has two parts âˆ’
 * 
 **  A pointcut expression that determines exactly which method executions we are interested in.
 *
 **  A pointcut signature comprising a name and any number of parameters.
 *   The actual body of the method is irrelevant and in fact should be empty.
